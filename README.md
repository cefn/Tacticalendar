# Tacticalendar

Laser-cut perpetual calendar design - features driven by customer requests through the github issue tracker.

You can find an instructable for constructing a Tacticalendar at http://www.instructables.com/id/Perpetual-horizon-calendar/

We now share all our SVGs from the development process here in the github (formerly hosted on our website).

We no longer provide a commercial website at http://tacticalendar.co.uk, but there is an archive of the original at http://web.archive.org/web/20111122170714/http://tacticalendar.co.uk/

This is the README.md file originally from https://github.com/cefn/tacticalendar

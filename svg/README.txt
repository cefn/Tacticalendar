This folder contains a series of different releases of the Tacticalendar perpetual-horizon, laser-cut erasable planner.

Please note, laser-cutting vector lines can be so thin that you can't see them in a regular SVG viewer. Loading them in the free and open source SVG editor Inkscape and choosing View => Display Mode => Outline does the trick for me. Alternatively in Inkscape CTRL+A - Select All followed by CTRL+SHIFT+F - Fill and Stroke should enable you to change the stroke (line thickness). From Inkscape you can then export them to anything which suits you.

For v0.2rc2 there are PNG (portable network graphics) files alongside the SVGs, and I'll try to do this in the future, so that people can inspect the designs more easily.
